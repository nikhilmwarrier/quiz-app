    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hello!<br />My name is Nikhil M Warrier. I am interested in Web Development, and I created this quiz app as a side project. Since this is a PWA (more on that later), you can just tap that install button in the home page, and it will be installed on your device.<br />
        <br /> This site is a PWA (Progressive Web App). It is an emerging technology, to substitute native apps with lighter, faster web apps which looks and feels just like a native app. Some work offline, too. SillyQuestions' home and about pages are viewable offline, but (given obvious reasons) the quizzes themselves require an active internet connection to work. The most amazing aspect of PWAs are that they are <i>tiny</i>. They are usually less than 1mb in size, owing to the fact that they are just webpages on a mild dose of steroids.<br />
        <br />BTW, I hand-coded this app in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. No playing around with messy frameworks or third-party stylesheets!<br />
        <br />For more info, you can <a href="contact.html">contact me.</a><br />
        Or <a href="submit-quiz.html">submit a quiz</a> if you've got nothing better to do.<br />
        <br />Or, heck, go <a href="index.html">home</a> and take another quiz, if that pleases you. <br /><br /><br />
        [BTW, this project is still under the <span class="beta">BETA</span> stage of development. There will be bugs and incomplete features. If you notice any bugs, please report it <a href="contact.html">here.</a>]
    </p></body>
